# image-to-markdown
Tool that converts an image of a document to a markdown file.

## Optical character recognition
### Options
- The Google Vision API has an optical character recognition (OCR) that makes it possible to [read text from images](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr).
- [Microsoft OCR APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr).
- [Amazon Rekognition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/text-detection.html).

I might go with the Google service. This seems super straight forward.
